 Python code to automate sending emails about students test scores

As I'm learning Python I'm looking for ways to use it in my every day life as a teacher. This is the first project I made that I'll actually be able to use that way.

The scores.csv would need to be updated with parent names and emails as well as student names and student scores (I left all of that out for obvious privacy reasons)

script.txt and noscore.txt would need to be updated with teacher email, name, subject, school, and tutorial day/off period (Again, all left out for privacy)

main.py just needs to have the teacher email, password, and host if not using outlook (most schools use that in my experience though) as well as the subject line for the sent email

Both of the .txt files could be cleaned up or worded to fit how you speak better if desired but it fits me pretty well so thats how they are
