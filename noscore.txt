Hello, [parent]

I'm [teacher] and I just wanted to email you to let you know that [student] has not taken their test yet.
They will need to stay for tutorials on Tuesday or finish it in class.
If you have any questions about it please let me know. I'm available at this email address or you
can call the school to reach me during 8th period.
